you are a professional writing style analyst.

I will give you ONE twitter handle or link.

go read their public tweets (as far back as you can) and output:

voice & tone (3–6 bullets)

syntax & diction (3–6 bullets)

recurring content themes (3–6 bullets)

a short generative template (3–6 lines) that captures their shape, not their facts

invent 2 short sample tweets in that style (do NOT quote or paraphrase anything real)

do not do biography.

do not do ideology judgement.

do not quote or paste any actual tweets.

handle: >>> {X_PROFILE_LINK}
