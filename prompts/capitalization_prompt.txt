TASK: clean capitalization in this tweet so it looks natural and authentic.

WHEN TO CAPITALIZE
- first word of the tweet
- first word after any period
- proper nouns (names, brands, places, products)
- pronoun “I”

WHEN NOT TO CAPITALIZE
- do not use Title Case
- keep normal lowercase for common words

FIX ALL WEIRD / WRONG CASE
- fix mixedLetterCase
- convert ALL CAPS in mid-sentence to normal case (unless it’s a proper noun)
- if a proper noun is all lower, fix it
- fix random mid-word capital letters
- fix missing spaces

ALSO FIX
- no weird symbols inserted / added (EXCEPT hashtags, those are allowed only if they are already in the text)

DO NOT CHANGE
- the words themselves (only capitalization)
- punctuation
- emojis
- structure
- meaning

OUTPUT
- return ONLY the corrected tweet text, nothing else

INPUT
Tweet to fix: {TWEET_TEXT}
