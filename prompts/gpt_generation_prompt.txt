{EXTRACTED_TWEETS}

CRITICAL RULES:
1. MUST be EXACTLY {MAX_TWEET_LENGTH} characters or LESS - this is a hard limit, no exceptions. Count carefully. The link will be added separately.
2. Include 2-3 emojis
3. Natural punctuation and spacing
4. Match the writing style, tone, voice, syntax, diction, and rhetorical patterns described in the style analysis above
5. Use the generative template from SECTION 4 as a guide for the structure and style
6. Be concise - remove unnecessary words if needed to stay under {MAX_TWEET_LENGTH} characters


IMPORTANT: Look carefully at the product image. Extract and include:
- Prices, discounts, percentages
- Sale prices and original prices if visible
- Any numbers related to deals, savings, or promotions
- Any promotional codes or discount amounts shown in the image

Make sure to include these numbers naturally in the tweet as part of the promotional message.

Return ONLY the tweet. NO explanations, NO rules commentary, NO meta-text. Just the tweet itself.
