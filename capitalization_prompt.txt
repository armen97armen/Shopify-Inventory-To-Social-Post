Fix the capitalization of this tweet to make it look natural and authentic. Only capitalize where it makes sense naturally:
- Capitalize the first letter of the first word
- Capitalize proper nouns (names, brands, places)
- Capitalize "I" 
- Capitalize the first letter of sentences after periods
- Keep lowercase for most other words unless it's a proper noun or the start of a sentence
- Don't force Title Case on everything - keep it natural like a real tweet

IMPORTANT: Fix ALL weird capitalization patterns you encounter:
- If you see mixed case words - fix them to proper capitalization
- If you see all caps words in the middle of a sentence - convert them to proper case (or proper noun capitalization if it's a proper noun)
- If you see all lowercase proper nouns - capitalize them properly
- Fix any mixed case issues where letters are randomly capitalized
- Fix words with missing spaces between them
- Handle any capitalization pattern that looks unnatural or incorrect

Do NOT change:
- The words themselves (only fix capitalization)
- The punctuation
- The emojis
- The overall structure and meaning

Return ONLY the fixed capitalized tweet text. NO explanations, NO commentary.
