Extract the latest 20 recent tweets from this X (Twitter) profile HTML: {X_PROFILE_LINK}

Analyze the HTML content provided below. Look for tweet content in:
- Elements with data-testid="tweetText"
- Article elements containing tweet text
- Div elements with class names containing "tweet" or "text"
- Span elements with text content that looks like tweets
- Any element containing tweet-like text content

Extract ONLY the tweet texts, one per line. Do not include:
- Usernames or @ mentions (unless it's part of the tweet content like mentioning another user)
- Timestamps, dates, or time information
- Retweet counts, like counts, reply counts, or any metrics
- Profile information or navigation text
- Empty or very short text (less than 10 characters)

Keep hashtags and emojis if they are part of the tweet text itself.
Just return the pure tweet text content, one tweet per line.
Extract as many tweets as you can find, up to 20 tweets.

If you cannot find ANY tweets in the HTML, return exactly: NO_TWEETS_FOUND

Example output format:
First tweet text here
Second tweet text here
Third tweet text here
